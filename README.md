# Advanced-Analysis-of-Job-Listings-in-India-

**Description**:
Conducted an end-to-end analysis of data analyst job listings in India using Python, SQL, and Power BI. The project involved data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, statistical hypothesis testing, machine learning modeling, advanced SQL queries, and dynamic visualizations to extract insights and support data-driven decision-making.

**Key Responsibilities**:

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handled missing values, standardized salary and experience columns, and transformed raw data for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identified trends in job listings based on location, company, and experience level using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
Statistical Analysis: Conducted hypothesis testing to compare job ratings across platforms and performed correlation analysis between ratings and reviews.
Machine Learning: Developed a Random Forest Regression model to predict base salary and performed feature selection using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE).
SQL Querying & Database Management:
Wrote complex SQL queries to extract insights, including the top companies by job ratings.
Created Stored Procedures to extract experience levels and update salary fields.
Developed Triggers to update job listing dates dynamically.
Designed Views to filter job listings with complete salary information.
Power BI Dashboard & Visualization: Built interactive dashboards to visualize job trends, salary distributions, and experience levels. Implemented DAX functions for custom metrics.
